Miller was the treasurer and general manager of Carolina Coal and Ice Company. The original house burned down circa late 1940s, and a new structure was built over its foundations, using the original stones. Montford Historic District retains more than 600 buildings, most of which were built between 1890 and 1920, and includes a variety of architectural influences reflecting the cosmopolitan character of Asheville during the turn of the 20th century. Victorian, Queen Anne and Arts and Crafts styles combined with Neoclassical, Colonial Revival and castle-like motifs, result in an overall complex quality of designs and artistic talent throughout the neighborhood. Asheville architect Richard Sharp Smith produced numerous residential homes in Montford. Smith's preference for pebbledash, shingles, high-pitched roofs and heavy stone foundations contributed to an overall form for the neighborhood. http://go.ncsu.edu/1906directory; http://go.ncsu.edu/montfordnews_pdf","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressLocality":"171 Montford Avenue","addressRegion":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28801"},"geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":"35.601299","longitude":"-82.563282"}}]}
