There is no West Asheville Street on modern maps. Either the street name changed, or the directory simply meant that the school was in the western part of Asheville. 1930 census records describe the school as being located in \"Lower Hominy Townplace\" in Buncombe, one of the county's 16 townships.  In 1923 the Lindley Training School was bought by the city of Asheville and later became part of the city's first junior college. http://go.ncsu.edu/westernnc_chronology; http://go.ncsu.edu/1909directory","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressLocality":null,"addressRegion":"North Carolina"},"geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":"35.54","longitude":"-82.68"}}]}
