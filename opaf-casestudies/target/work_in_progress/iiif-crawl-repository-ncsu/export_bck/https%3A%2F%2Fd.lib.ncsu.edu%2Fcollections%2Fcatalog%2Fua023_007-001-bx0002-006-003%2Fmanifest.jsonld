(John Tyler), 1911-1995","description":"Born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, in 1911, John Caldwell received a B.S. from Mississippi State College, an M.A. from Duke University, and a Ph.D. from Princeton University. A political scientist, Caldwell held teaching appointments at Holmes Junior College from 1932 to 1936, and Vanderbilt University from 1939 to 1947. In 1947, Caldwell was named President of Alabama College (later the University of Montevallo) and subsequently became President of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. In 1959, Caldwell became Chancellor of North Carolina State College, which was renamed North Carolina State University during his tenure in 1965. Under Caldwell's leadership, the student and faculty population nearly doubled, the School of Physical Sciences and Applied Mathematics was established, and for the first time the university offered a full range of degree programs in the humanities and social sciences. Caldwell retired as chancellor in 1975, but afterward he continued to teach in the Department of Political Science. He died in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1995.
