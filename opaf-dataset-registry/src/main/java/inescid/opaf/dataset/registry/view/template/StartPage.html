</head>
<body>

<h2>R&D Workbench for alternative aggregation mechanisms for Europeana</h2>
<p>It is a work in progress.
gather info from providers and aggregators, share results, apply prototypes, show demonstrators.</p>
<p>Current R&D activities address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregation mechanisms for linked data</li>
<li>Aggregation mechanisms for IIIF based on Activity Streams 2.0</li>
<li>Aggregation mechanisms for IIIF based on IIIF Collections</li>
<li>Aggregation mechanisms for IIIF based on Sitemaps</li>
<li>Aggregation mechanisms specific for Schema.org metadata (e.g. HTML Crawlers)</li>
<li>Conversion of Schema.org metadata to EDM</li>
</ul>
<p>Current operations available in the workbench:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8080/opaf-dataset-registry/lod-dataset-register">Register a LOD dataset for aggregation by Europeana</a>:<br/>
Allows data providers and aggregators to send us the description of a dataset where we will experiment the LOD aggregation mechanisms.<br/>
The guidelines for descibing a LOD dataset for Europeana are [add link: avalable in this document]</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8080/opaf-dataset-registry/iiif-dataset-register">Register a IIIF dataset for aggregation by Europeana</a>:<br/>Allows data providers and aggregators to send us the description of a dataset where we will experiment the IIIF aggregation mechanisms. May be used for aggregation via IIIF Collections and Sitemaps. Harvesting based on Activity Streams is not supported yet</li>
</ul>
